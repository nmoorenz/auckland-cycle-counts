Auckland cycle counts from here
https://at.govt.nz/cycling-walking/research-monitoring/monthly-cycle-monitoring

With inspiration for analysis from here
https://awcc.mrcagney.works/

And probably a Shiny project at some stage
[link to that]

TODO: 
- Create a script to standardise the files
  - convert xlsx to csv
  - different functions for different file layouts
  - split into different months or years
- Analysis
  - create some charts
  - create some interactive charts
  - create functions to replicate AT reports
  - check AT website to see issues with the data
- Shiny
  - pretty much just copy the MRCagney Dash site with Shiny
  - decide if I would or if I have to do anything differently
